#ACTARSim 

##ACTARSIM, a simulation package developed to determine the response of the ACTAR-TPC Active Target and other similar Active Target projects, as well as their ancillary detectors. 
ACTARSim is a simulation package developed to determine the response of the ACTAR-TPC Active Target and other similar Active Target projects, as well as their ancillary detectors. It uses Geant4 to track the beam and the reaction particles, and a ROOT-based code for the description of the electrons in the Active Target gas and the response of the detector after the electrons drift and diffusion. This software combination allows a versatile and modular configuration of different detector geometries, description of gas mixtures and pad plane detection methods of different shapes and sizes.
