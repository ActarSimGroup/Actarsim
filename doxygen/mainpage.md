\mainpage %ACTARSIM Reference Documentation

### Introduction
Welcome to %ACTARSIM

This documentation describes the software classes and functions that makes up the %ACTARSIM simulation code.
This is not an introduction of %ACTARSIM, for this please refer to  the [%ACTARSIM User Guides and Manuals](https://github.com/ActarSimGroup/Actarsim).
This documentation is generated directly from the source code using [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) and in principle is kept up to date.
The version of %ACTARSIM corresponding to this documentation is indicated at the page heading.

### How to use this reference documentation
The full list of classes are available under the [All Classes](annotated.html) tab.
The fully indexed list of all source code is available under the tab [Files](files.html).

### Caveat
We have moved recently to generate the documentation with Doxygen.
To achieve this the comments in the source code needed to be formatted and written specifically for Doxygen to generated proper documentation.
If you find missing documentation or inaccuracies please report them to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ActarSimGroup/Actarsim).
