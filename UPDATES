- Removed the entrance beam commands to simplify. Now one should only use the beamPosition/Direction to control the beam
- Added the Gas Mixture feature. Now we can make any type of mixture by setting the number of elements /ActarSim/det/gas/GasMixture N,
  setting all gases with their ratio /ActarSim/det/gas/setGasMix GasNum GasMat GasRatio and finally setting in the gas box and chamber
  /ActarSim/det/gas/setGasMat GasMix.
